# Detail views and turned inspection baseline — verification, 2026-10-17

## Maintainer decision and requested revisions — 2026-10-16

This is the authoritative current verification; earlier merge reports below are historical.
The base is PR #72/main `0af1323e`; the pre-fix head is `0d8b2381`. No push, baseline
re-recording, quality/instruction/latency threshold changes, ignored tests or latency override
was used. Evidence is under
`target/detail-review/`. The content survey preserves original STEP basenames, including
when decompressing or deduplicating, since title text participates in layout. The final
survey archives its executable; all delivered renders and performance counts use the same
final native executable (`binary-final.json`).

### Drawing fixes and deliberate choices

* Recovery searches ordinary complete drawings first under the existing sheet rules, including
  practical-paper multi-sheet allocation. Optional details cannot cap a valid principal scale.
  The head caps are removed; detail quality is assessed only when the candidate actually has a
  detail. Thus an earlier detail cannot veto a later ordinary drawing. Required measurement
  retention includes compiler-proven baseline intervals only while their controlling owner is
  drawn; independent toleranced lengths retain their own IDs and statements.
* Rectangular crops use **continuous thin zigzag break lines** at cut geometry, rather than
  fabricated solid cap edges. Each cut endpoint meets the boundary. This preserves dimension
  witnesses and the existing semantic crop; a circular crop could remove those witnesses.
  The parent circle still identifies the region. Exact curve intervals remain exact, and line
  intersections are calculated directly. The same convention covers clipped thread/knurl ink.
* Captions are centred on the real visible detail ink and sit **8 paper mm below its bottom**,
  matching Python's `dvb.min.Y - cap_h`. Planning reserves the corresponding crop-footprint
  row. The `issue_trust` test now asserts that real rendered anchor; this is a correction of
  the reservation-bottom assertion, not a weakened test. The former automatic-head bounds,
  owned-dimension, marker and sheet-scale iso assertions remain exercised at an explicit
  constrained main scale, alongside the new exact default sheet/scale/no-detail assertions.
  The caption row and its half-text-height clearance now participate in initial dimension
  solving and later settlement. The complete run caught this missing reservation on the
  unrecovered GRM-03 seed; all 214 unit tests and 115 focused integration regressions pass after the fixes
  (`whole-head-regressions.log`, `whole-head-final-regressions.log`). X-profile top padding counts every owned horizontal length row;
  the 0.5 mm GRM-03 head length consequently stays inside its reserved band. Break-line
  strokes belong to the visible ink bounds used for the caption anchor. The strict structural catalogue and caption anchor remain unchanged.
* Prismatic crops keep the whole feature width rather than a support-centred strip. They start
  at Python's preferred 2/5/10 scale multiple, not its 1.2× fallback floor. A crop that cannot
  fit at that enlargement is withheld. 10103 returns to larger complete principal views.
  X-axis heads keep complete selected radial profiles rather than thin strips around their
  positive rims. On constrained GRM-03 the full head is withheld at A4 2:1 and fits at A3 2:1
  with detail A 10:1. Both outcomes are tested against actual visible geometry and owned
  dimensions. Default GRM-03 remains A3 10:1 without a detail. A shoulder exactly on a
  crop boundary retains its break contacts even if adjoining edges have zero retained length.
* `crop_extent` maps only the eight envelope corners; it clones no `Analysis`. Geometry computes
  it once per view, including the cache key, and reuses its rectangle for every curve. Parent
  marker bounds also avoid clones. Larger-paper optional omissions are decided before planning,
  eliminating the previous plan-then-omit-and-plan-again sequence. Both searches share the
  same candidate cache and original seed. The optional search refuses candidates without an
  actual surviving automatic detail before solving annotation ink; it still tries its alternate
  detail lane. The ordinary fallback remains authoritative when detail recovery is invalid. When both
  searches refuse, the diagnostic retains both actual candidate histories instead of
  replacing the ordinary search with the shorter optional-search refusal.
* The inspection-end baseline, PMI precedence, isometric visible-edge precedence, saved-spec
  resolution, authored `from`/string-or-list `around`, section-source planes, and K5 body-local
  chains remain. All 14 saved string-post tolerances remain individually drawn.
* Plate-chain coverage also accepts independently proven turned-band baseline intervals. It
  reuses the unchanged turned linter, filters suppressed ink, and retains same-body, axis-line
  and contiguous-span requirements. Forward/reverse baseline regressions remove every
  controlling mark in turn and reject wrong values, unrelated claims, other bodies and other
  axis lines. The GRM-03 chain test now checks both complete parent and detail representations
  and independently proves all eight band requirements; it does not demand a redundant local
  2 mm label in the baseline-only drawing. All 31 plate/chain focused tests pass
  (`plate-baseline-regressions.log`).

The Python sm-hanger report was checked: detail A needs 1.75 and is placed at 2.0. The Rust
ordinary A3 1:2 drawing retains its required dimensions and wins under the practical-paper
rule. The smaller A4 string_post_tapped 2:1 trial is not clean: its position-control leader
crosses the ø7.5 label. A fresh final-binary trial explicitly omitting every automatic detail
confirms both the ink overlap and leader crossing
([PNG](../target/detail-review/tapped-a4.png), `tapped-a4.plan.json`). It therefore remains on A3 5:1. The pre-existing
unsupported 1.2 PMI location remains reported; no PMI is silently discarded. The explicitly
requested threaded_connector_109 check remains a limitation: A4 1:10 has densely modelled
thread ink and crowded left-hand callouts. It is not a satisfactory thread drawing, even
though its bounded layout checks pass; no thread pitch/type was invented or lint suppressed.

### MCP schema size

The extension introduced the *entire typed detail record* into twelve standalone Spec schemas;
the previous view values were opaque objects. That explains **42,356 → 47,732 bytes**, rather
than two optional fields alone. There are no redundant copies inside a standalone schema.
A disjoint string/array type replaces the inlined union and an exact compact pattern replaces
the repeated source enum. Nulls, nonempty typed lists, source vocabulary, scale bounds and
strict detail properties are retained, including rejection of trailing newlines and mismatched
section letters. The final total is **46,868 bytes**, **864 fewer**, with the minimum honest
strict cap **<46,869** in the generator and Rust guard.

### Actual output and visual inspection

Every PNG below was opened and inspected. Final rerenders are byte-identical to that inspected
set, and the live, archived and survey executables have the same SHA-256
(`final-integrity.json`). SVG, Plan JSON and render review JSON are beside each PNG.
The drawing check distinguishes preserved layout findings from claims of manufacturing readiness.

10170 is a useful default-detail fallback: B at 2:1 enlarges the 5.1/10.4 mm height
group, widening the adjacent paper gap from 5.3 to 10.5 mm across the 7 mm parent spacing
floor on A3. It uses a readable full-width feature and an explicit break line. Forced
detail-free recovery retains the height claims but finds no clean candidate:
two hole locations remain too close to read. The detail improves the step group; it does not
resolve those unrelated findings. The constrained crowded_prism example demonstrates the
same convention on close steps. The AP242 CTC02 detail B at 1:2.5 doubles the principal
scale for the 8/30 mm steps, widening their paper gap from 4.4 to 8.8 mm across the same
7 mm spacing floor without moving the already-required large sheet up again.
Its forced ordinary recovery also retains the claims but exhausts the legal candidates with
hard layout and hole-legibility findings. Both drawings honestly remain `needs_attention`;
neither detail is presented as curing all pre-existing whole-drawing findings. The comparison
Plans are in `detail-reasons/` and `detail-reasons.json`.
Authored details remain explicit user intent; constrained-scale head and chain tests continue to exercise their geometry and ownership.

### 227-part base/head survey

227 drawable unique STEP contents were compared, plus the intentionally unresolved fixture. There are **2 sheet/scale changes**, **0 new error findings**, **0 lost placed PMI items**, **0 altered PMI labels/values/claims**, and **0 new A2+ moves** from A4/A3. Full Plans, source aliases, findings and provenance are retained in `base/`, `final/` and `comparison/comparison.json`.

| Part | Base | Final |
| --- | --- | --- |
| corpus/cadgenbench/threaded_connector_109.step | A2 1:2 / 1 sheet(s) | A4 1:10 / 1 sheet(s) |
| fixtures/pmi/step/string_post_tapped.step.gz | A4 2:1 / 1 sheet(s) | A3 5:1 / 1 sheet(s) |

Compared with the reviewed pre-fix head, the following sheets/scales change (unchanged rows are omitted):

| Part | Reviewed head | Final |
| --- | --- | --- |
| corpus/gramel/GRM-03_thumbwheel_drive_screw.step | A4 2:1 / 1 sheet(s) | A3 10:1 / 1 sheet(s) |

| fixtures/rule_pins/framed.step.gz | A4 1:1 / 1 sheet(s) | A3 2:1 / 1 sheet(s) |

Default automatic detail-bearing parts drop from **30 at the reviewed head to two**. Details retained:

* `corpus/mfcadpp/10170.step`: B 2:1 (prismatic-steps, 2 owned requirements).
* `fixtures/pmi/step/nist_ctc_02_asme1_ap242-e2.stp.gz`: B 1:2.5 (prismatic-steps, 2 owned requirements).

All 39 saved sm-hanger Specs were replayed against main, the pre-fix binary and final. 17 prior small-to-large regressions return to A4/A3 (Spec indices [3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 26, 33, 34, 37]). The final distribution is 21 A3, 15 A4, two explicitly requested A0, and the same unknown-`rear` refusal as main. Findings remain in `hanger-*/summary.json` and `hanger-comparison.json`.

### Thirty quality parts: regenerated current Rust comparison

Rust values are regenerated from the final `quality/*.plan.json`. Python values retain the
previously inspected reports; they are not a claim of a fresh Python rebuild.

### Retired instructions

Counts are Darwin `proc_pid_rusage` instructions, not load-dependent wall time. The before executable is the untouched `0d8b2381` build.

| Part | Before | After | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| sm-hanger | 4,066,886,339 | 3,072,782,457 | -24.4% |
| ctc01 | 14,708,894,153 | 12,041,734,944 | -18.1% |
| ftc10 | 31,538,538,914 | 27,148,068,327 | -13.9% |
| 10060 | 1,428,472,512 | 1,372,016,081 | -4.0% |
| ctc02 | 230,524,717,241 | 227,797,385,798 | -1.2% |
| string_post | 4,747,377,929 | 4,786,218,344 | +0.8% |

Full unchanged 65-part `check_plan_time`: **2,922,881,614,872 instructions**, limit **3,165,755,533,285**, 242.3 s wall time: **PASS**. Per-part counts and platform/budget are in `plan-time.json`.
The first full measurement failed at 3,651,346,847,255 instructions; shared candidate work and
early refusal brought it under the unchanged gate. Earlier measurements and the interrupted
caption-reservation diagnostic are retained in `perf-diagnostic/` and `caption-diagnostic/`.

### Required checks

Commands source `$HOME/.cargo/env` and set `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 RUST_TEST_THREADS=4`; corpus tests set both required corpus variables. Each requested check ran one at a time.

| Check | Exit | Log under `target/detail-review/` |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| fmt | 0 | `fmt.log` |
| clippy | 0 | `clippy.log` |

Final required-corpus release run: **1,132 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored across 112 targets** (`test-summary.json`, `tests.log`).

The earlier full run is retained in `stale-grm-diagnostic/tests.log`: 1,130 passed, two failed,
none ignored. One test still demanded a redundant local GRM-03 2 mm label. Its correction
keeps exact printed-label, isometric and raw-sheet assertions, independently proves all eight
physical band quantities from actual placed ink, removes each controlling baseline station in
turn, and checks the recovered A3 10:1 drawing without a detail. All 36 drafting tests then
passed, followed by the complete 1,132-test release rerun above.

The other earlier failure was the unchanged NIST session wall-clock gate: p90/max **428.290 ms**
against **150 ms**, with the other eight samples at 7.8–37.2 ms. It passes on the final full
rerun. No gate, test-thread setting or latency override was changed. Both outcomes are
reported rather than replacing the failed measurement.

An earlier diagnostic also exposed a direct-claims-only sheet-selection oracle: GRM-03's
2 mm shoulder is now determined by the printed 0.5 and 2.5 mm baseline stations. The corrected
oracle independently reads placed annotations and checks real shoulder geometry through
`lint::turned::outcomes`; it does not trust the planner's `Covered` ledger. The same strict
before/after physical-outcome subset and independent sheet-rule assertions remain. The exact
Rust/Python dimension catalogue also now records five moved labels under their actual parent
view, and both sides of sm-hanger's 65 mm view equivalence. The comparison still checks every stated label and count bidirectionally; none of
its matching assertions is relaxed. The repeated-label catalogue restores main’s exact CTC01
verdict: the two 50 mm quantities span 100–150 and 0–50 respectively. Stale view-difference
entries are removed only when the compared views now agree or cease to be common; the
hanger view-set difference records the deliberate full-width crop refusal. Three rule
citations point to the replacement default/constrained tests; rule statuses stay unchanged. With the full head withheld on the small estimate, five GRM-03 dimension exceptions and
one view exception disappear because the parent statements match directly. This reduces
the exception catalogue; the strict comparison and placed-quantity checks remain.
Caption anchoring was corrected as described above.

All **300 quality cells across 30 parts pass** the unchanged acceptance baseline: ink
**52 → 51**, material crossings **73 → 73**, repeated labels **7 → 7**, hidden-on-visible
**2,231 → 0**, all other gated totals remain zero. The leader check passes **119 callouts on
30 parts**, with 14 unchanged pre-existing long runs. WASM builds with `wasm-opt`; parity
passes all **3** replay tests. Final WASM size: raw **13,718,899**, gzip **4,532,165**, Brotli
**3,002,822 bytes**. All 26 published and served schemas for 13 tools validate independently.
`gate-integrity.json` records the six unchanged rule/gate hashes and checks all 14 tolerance
labels; `visual-inspection.json` records the opened final PNG hashes and observations.
`final-integrity.json` confirms those checks again against the final archived executables and
all fifteen delivered rerenders; `visual-inspection-a4-trial.json` records the separate tapped
A4 trial.

## Historical merge onto main `0af1323e` (PRs #67–#72), 2026-10-16

This section supersedes earlier verification below. The merge parents are `2348ce47`
and `0af1323e`. Both prior merge commits (`7b39ab9e`, `2348ce47`) and incoming changes
were read before resolution, including the coverage/holes ports and `9bd23cf1`'s
fit-label reservations, linear anchor frame and post-GD&T settlement. Work proceeded
unattended, retaining class-only fits by default and the exact saved 14-tolerance spec.

### Resolutions

* `CHANGELOG.md` retains the detail/inspection entries and incoming WASM package entries
  under Unreleased, with one Added section followed by Fixed.
* `src/model.rs` retains optional-detail refusal at fallback pairs and rebuilds the whole
  geometry with empty scaled details when an optional crop is refused. That effective
  empty reservation also feeds the anchor calculation, so no phantom detail strips return.
  For surviving details, the anchored request uses the same scaled-detail reservations;
  principal and iso anchors are applied to the detail-aware geometry, and the section's
  reserved boxes receive the section translation. Full printed ink still reserves its
  blocks. Main's body-local turned corridors and post-GD&T fit settlement remain intact.
  The detail marker initializes the new rendered arrowhead field to an empty vector.
* `docs/rules/README.md` combines both streams' evidence and removes the duplicated stale
  tables. Counts recomputed from every YAML `status`: **47 pending, 272 ported, 125
  translated, 71 retired** (ADR 7/66/61/26; lint 9/123/14/19; issues 31/83/50/26).
* The first release run exposed the combined MCP schema size (42,552 bytes against the
  unchanged 42,500-byte cap). The generator now hoists a type shared by every `anyOf`
  branch, preserving exactly the same accepted values; generated schemas total 42,296
  bytes. It also explicitly carries detail_a–detail_h in placement choices, matching the
  branch's already checked-in schema. A new strictness regression checks valid/null states,
  missing fields, wrong types and detail placement names. The size assertion stays intact.
* The quality baseline, instruction budget, acceptance tools, independent sheet-rule
  checker and R5 latency gate match incoming main byte for byte. No test or threshold
  is weakened and no baseline is re-recorded. `target/detail-main-72/gate-integrity.json`
  records hashes; native stateless tests keep the branch's pre-existing cache regressions.

### Checks

Commands source `$HOME/.cargo/env` and use `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 RUST_TEST_THREADS=4`.
Native tests require `DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS=/Users/paul/repos/quiddity/tests/corpus` and
`DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS_REQUIRED=1`. All evidence in this section is under
`target/detail-main-72/`.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo fmt --all --check` | Pass | `fmt-final.log` |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --release -- -D warnings` | Pass | `clippy-final.log` |
| Required-corpus `cargo test --release --no-fail-fast` | **1,117 pass, one wall-clock latency failure**, zero ignored, 112 targets; earlier complete run **1,118 pass** | `tests-final.log`, `test-summary-final.json` |
| `tools/quality.py`, exact 30-part manifest, then `tools/ci_acceptance.py --check-results quality --baseline tools/ci-quality-baseline.json` | **All 300 cells pass; nothing worse** | `quality-command.json`, `quality-final.log`, `quality-acceptance-final.log`, `quality/baseline.json` |
| `python3 -I tools/check_leader_routes.py target/detail-main-72/quality` | **119 callouts / 30 parts pass**; 14 unchanged pre-existing long runs | `leader-routes-final.log` |
| `python3 -I tools/check_plan_time.py --out target/detail-main-72/plan-time.json` | **Pass: 3,079,008,034,594 instructions**, below **3,165,755,533,285**; Darwin arm64, 65 parts, 767.1 s wall time under load | `plan-time.json`, `plan-time-final.log` |
| `python3 -I tools/test_ci_acceptance.py` with corpus enabled | **24 pass**, none skipped | `ci-acceptance-tests.log` |
| `wasm-pack build crates/draftwright-wasm --target web --profile wasm-release --locked` | Pass, including `wasm-opt` | `wasm-build-final.log`, `crates/draftwright-wasm/pkg/` |
| `node --test tools/wasm-parity.test.mjs` | **3 pass**; both replay sessions match native plan/spec/SVG bytes | `wasm-parity.log` |

The first complete no-fail-fast run passed **1,118 tests, zero failed or ignored, across
112 targets**, including both R5 and NIST latency gates (`tests-diagnostic.log`,
`test-summary-complete.json`). It includes the final schema strictness regression and
passes the source fingerprint check. The latency gate environment override was unset.

The initial exact `cargo test --release` stopped at the schema byte-cap regression described
above (`tests.log`). The focused engine/schema rerun passes all 13 tests (`schema-tests.log`);
no size limit was changed. The initial WASM invocation compiled successfully but could not
lock the tool cache outside the sandbox (`wasm-build.log`). The successful rerun sets
`WASM_PACK_CACHE` to `target/detail-main-72/wasm-pack-cache/`, using copies of the already
installed wasm-bindgen/wasm-opt binaries. No optimization or build step was disabled.

Quality totals against main: ink **52 → 49**, material intersections **73 → 69**,
hidden-on-visible **2,231 → 0**, repeated labels **7 → 6**; the other gated totals remain
zero. The 30 final Plan JSONs and 30 SVGs are byte-identical to the first accepted run
(`quality-artifact-parity.json`). All six final PNGs are byte-identical to the images opened
for inspection (`final-png-parity.json`). `binary-final.json` identifies the final native
binary. The first 65-part instruction run also passed (3,077,329,051,669 instructions,
227.9 s wall time); its evidence is retained as `plan-time-before-schema-fix.json`.

The final repeated full run exits 101 solely for the unchanged R5 multi-sheet MCP wall-clock
gate: **p90 936.833 ms versus 150 ms** (max 980.860 ms). Its direct edit p90 is 29.148 ms;
MCP median retired instructions are 982,938,627, with one plan per edit and max wire size
1,132 bytes. The NIST session wall-clock gate passes. The earlier complete run passes both
latency gates. The failure is reported under load as requested: no timing threshold, test,
acceptance rule or baseline was changed. `r5-latency-final.log` and `latency-results.json`
retain the exact result. All non-timing tests pass.

### Requested drawings

All six PNGs were opened and visually inspected. SVG, Plan JSON and review JSON sit beside
each PNG in `target/detail-main-72/renders/`. `visual-inspection.json` records hashes and
observations; `fit-clearance.json` checks both default fit labels against every foreign
linear stroke and arrowhead with a 2 mm pad.

| Case | Outcome | PNG under `target/detail-main-72/renders/` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| string_post default | One A4 **2:1**, detail **B 10:1**; readable 1 mm flange and 2× R0.2, common high-end inspection baseline | [string_post.png](../target/detail-main-72/renders/string_post.png) |
| Saved 14-tolerance string_post spec | One A4 **2:1**, B **10:1**; all 14 tolerances printed, local lengths opposite the baseline | [string_post_spec.png](../target/detail-main-72/renders/string_post_spec.png) |
| CNC-review spindle | One A4 **1:1**; A's short bottom-face extension and B's right-side datum sit inside the dimension furniture; zero planner datum conflicts | [spindle.png](../target/detail-main-72/renders/spindle.png) |
| turned.step | One A3 **2:1**; 40 and 70 share the low end, shortest nearest the body | [turned.png](../target/detail-main-72/renders/turned.png) |
| mfcadpp 10224 | One A3 **2:1**; section A–A fits beside the front/side row, with ordinate stacks inside the border | [10224.png](../target/detail-main-72/renders/10224.png) |
| Maintainer's turned spindle | One A3 **2:1**; **ø10 g6** and **ø15 h6**, class only, both clear of foreign dimension lines/arrows by the 2 mm check | [turned_spindle_fits.png](../target/detail-main-72/renders/turned_spindle_fits.png) |

These are not claims that every drawing is globally finding-free. String_post and 10224
retain nominal-rounding review warnings. The saved spec has four reservation overruns;
10224 retains its unsupported angled-step and material-crossing reports. The CNC spindle
has one frame leader through a feature and two reservation overruns. Its structural review
retains the two datum stem/box boundary-contact `leader_line_through_text` reports documented
in the prior verification; the letters and stems are visibly clear. Neither spindle has a
planner annotation-leader crossing now, and the maintainer's spindle has no structural
findings. No report was suppressed to obtain the requested results.

## Merge onto main `717def3e` (PRs #56–#65), 2026-10-16

This section supersedes all earlier verification below. The incoming commits were read with
`git log 53aa9f3f..origin/main` after fetching origin; the merge parents are `7b39ab9e` and
`717def3e`. Work proceeded unattended, retaining main's approved triage and existing gates.

### Conflict resolutions and integration decisions

* `CHANGELOG.md`: kept both the detail/inspection-baseline entries and main's release,
  datum-placement and review-fix history. Detail changes sit under Unreleased, preserving
  the published alpha.3 history. Main's alpha.3 dependency pins are retained.
* `src/demand.rs`: retained the inspection baseline's left/top reserves and main's authored
  callout-band reservation, applied together.
* `src/planning.rs`: retained main's bounded Analysis preparation across session edits and
  the branch's exact process memos. Both cache invalidation and clone/drop-outside-lock tests
  remain. Both sets of `tests/pmi_thread_knurl.rs` tests remain: crop/transform correctness and
  complete compiler-bound manufacturing-row evidence.
* `src/sheet_fit.rs`: kept main's measured section correction before multi-sheet allocation.
  Cropped view bounds use the crop extent; detail captions and parent marker ink contribute
  to their owned measured blocks. Sections can move into the remaining space while principal
  projections and details stay fixed. The whole-row lift remains disabled for details so it
  cannot invalidate crop/source marker relationships. Main's 10224/10255 single-A3 tests remain.
* `src/model.rs` and `src/sheets.rs`: retained the automatic merge's detail-aware principal
  filters and quality gates, #63's single-sheet measured fit, then A4/A3 multi-sheet search,
  and only then eligibility for larger paper. Required measurement and per-sheet ink gates
  remain. The first runtime run found a real integration regression: measured fitting made a
  detail-free A4 5:1 candidate valid, so fill preference displaced string_post's A4 2:1 with
  head B 10:1. Accepted head-detail candidates now cap detail-free enlargement on the same or
  larger paper. The candidate trace explicitly records that eligibility decision; the independent
  sheet-rule oracle remains unchanged. The measured fitter itself stays available, including
  for the 10224 case.
* `src/dims/gdt.rs`: main's inside-lane datum placement, crossing grades, bounded searches and
  planar-face extension guard survive unchanged apart from initializing the new detail field.
  The inspection baseline, K6 correlated sets and covered ownership all remain. A new detail
  ownership regression checks unique claims and stable moved owner IDs in automatic and
  authored sets, including live owners for covered omissions. Main's short-shoulder regression
  is reconciled with the common baseline: default short/long variants must have live, unique
  baseline owners and complete physical coverage; explicitly toleranced bands must still
  print all three original IDs, claims and nominal lengths. The longer synthetic profile's
  envelope follows its extended far end. No coverage assertion or lint threshold is removed.
* Catalogue conflicts: main's statuses and table/pins/lint evidence are authoritative, except
  the branch's tested ports `ISSUE-443-a`, `ISSUE-1216-b` and
  `LINT-code-detail_caption_clearance`. Partial detail rules stay pending, translated rules
  stay translated, and stale detail limitations/test names are updated. Counts: 65 pending,
  252 ported, 127 translated, 71 retired. README counts are recomputed from the YAML.

The corpus-required diagnostic suite completed all 108 targets: 1,066 passed and seven
integration checks failed, with both latency gates passing. Every failure has a focused
passing rerun. In addition to the head-priority correction above:

* Whole correlated-ladder omissions retain the detail's reservations, as direct omissions
  already did; `placement::omitting_one_dimension_moves_no_other` again keeps every unrelated
  view and dimension fixed.
* The reference-to-controlling K6 regression uses the boss-circle fixture's real closed chain,
  since the turned fixture now intentionally has a nonredundant baseline. All positive and
  negative tolerance/fit lint assertions remain.
* Multi-sheet attempt records keep their results without nesting an entire candidate report.
  The independent sheet-rule parser is unchanged. Its over-view regression still rejects the
  crossing trial and verifies the actual bounds of each accepted A4/A3 page under #63.
* On larger paper, optional crops are omitted consistently across all arrangement trials,
  allowing the original parent-only fallback instead of skipping a valid paper/scale pair.
* A refused optional crop on an invalid seed does not veto a complete ordinary drawing.
  Actual detail candidates and valid starting drawings keep the annotation, crossing and
  leader-quality checks; main's required measurements, bounds and material-crossing gates
  remain. This restores 10255's measured single-A3 fit and 10190's A1 fallback.

### Plan-cost integration

The first complete merged suite passed 1,073 tests across 108 targets, including both
wall-clock latency gates. All 300 quality cells passed against main's unchanged baseline.
The initial macOS 65-part instruction check nevertheless exceeded the unchanged budget:
3,397,991,206,198 instructions against a 3,165,755,533,285 limit.

Leader refinement now rejects segments wholly outside a contact box before clipping,
stops counting a candidate when its unique-owner contact counts already exceed its existing
acceptance limits, and uses the existing conservative grid for nearby model strokes before
the same exact label/elbow contact tests. Surviving candidates retain exact counts and stable
ranking. The grid preserves duplicate strokes, inclusive boundary contacts and the existing
non-finite fallback. Two new unit regressions compare indexed results with exhaustive scans
and check unique-owner bounds and corner contacts. No score, threshold, survey member or
recorded baseline changes. Temporary profiling instrumentation is removed.

The profiled STC10 plan is byte-identical before/after these optimizations (SHA-256
`ae5843974695f7376c17c4a0f8d9c42efd7eccebb2ffe96a8333be4ac4ed5e6e`),
using 191,974,486,429 instructions instead of 239,890,736,263 (20.0% fewer).

### Final checks and drawings

The final source passed formatting, strict Clippy and the complete required-corpus release
suite: **1,075 passed, zero failed, zero ignored, across 108 targets**. Both the R5 and NIST
wall-clock latency gates passed without changing them. Commands ran one at a time with
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 RUST_TEST_THREADS=4`, after sourcing `$HOME/.cargo/env`.

| Check | Final outcome | Evidence under `target/detail-main-merge/` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo fmt --check` | Pass | `fmt-final.log` |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --release -- -D warnings` | Pass | `clippy-final.log` |
| `DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS=/Users/paul/repos/quiddity/tests/corpus DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS_REQUIRED=1 cargo test --release --no-fail-fast` | 1,075 pass; includes all six catalogue checks | `tests-final.log`, `test-summary-final.json` |
| `tools/quality.py` over the exact 30-part manifest, then `tools/ci_acceptance.py --check-results quality` against `tools/ci-quality-baseline.json` | All 300 cells pass; nothing worse | `quality-final.log`, `quality-acceptance-final.log`, `quality/baseline.json` |
| `python3 -I tools/check_leader_routes.py target/detail-main-merge/quality` | 119 callouts on 30 parts pass; 14 unchanged pre-existing long runs | `leader-routes-final.log`, `leader-routes-final.json` |
| `DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS=/Users/paul/repos/quiddity/tests/corpus python3 -I tools/check_plan_time.py --out target/detail-main-merge/plan-time-grid.json` | Darwin arm64: **3,038,967,217,470 instructions**, below **3,165,755,533,285** limit; 65 parts, 201.4 s wall time | `plan-time-grid.json`, `plan-time-grid.log` |
| `DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS=/Users/paul/repos/quiddity/tests/corpus python3 -I tools/test_ci_acceptance.py` | All 24 pass, zero skipped | `ci-acceptance-tests-final.log` |

Quality totals improve from main's baseline: ink 52 → 49, material intersections 73 → 69,
hidden-on-visible 2,231 → 0 and repeated labels 7 → 6. All other gated totals stay zero.
The instruction count is 1.104 times the recorded figure, inside its unchanged 1.15 limit.
The accepted native binary SHA-256 is
`c5235fb93e21c4e280193ec08126a3f78d4e0914175ac20c6006c8da307ebbe7`;
it is unchanged after the final full-suite build. All **30 Plan JSONs and 30 SVGs are
byte-identical** to the validated pre-optimization outputs (`quality-perf-parity.json`).
The budget, quality baseline, acceptance tools and independent sheet-rule oracle match
`origin/main` byte for byte (`gate-integrity.json`). No baseline was re-recorded.
The acceptance unit log's `survey: FAIL` line is its intentional bad-evidence test; the
suite exits successfully. Its initial run skipped the full-survey error test without the
corpus environment; the final run above executes all 24.

All five PNGs below were opened at native resolution and inspected for witness support,
common origins, label clearance, section/detail identification, scales and sheet boundaries.
SVGs, Plan JSON and complete review JSON accompany them. `visual-inspection.json` records
PNG hashes and observations; `verification-assertions.json` records the requested criteria.

| Case | Verified result and draftsman's inspection | PNG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| string_post default | One A4 2:1 with B 10:1. Heights 3.8, 6.5, 7.6 and 14.8 share the high flat end. The 1 mm flange and 2× R0.2 are readable in B; source marker and captions stay clear. | [string_post.png](../target/detail-main-merge/renders/string_post.png) |
| Saved 14-tolerance string_post spec | One A4 2:1 with B 10:1. Original quantities retain all 14 tolerances; local band lengths sit opposite the baseline, with clear witnesses and no off-sheet labels. | [string_post_spec.png](../target/detail-main-merge/renders/string_post_spec.png) |
| CNC-review spindle | One A4 1:1. B is inside the right dimension lanes; A uses a short left extension of the bottom face. Both datums have **zero planner crossings or overlaps**, with clear letters and stems in the PNG. | [spindle.png](../target/detail-main-merge/renders/spindle.png) |
| turned.step | One A3 2:1. The 40 and 70 dimensions share the large low end, shortest nearest the part; no redundant 30 reference remains. | [turned.png](../target/detail-main-merge/renders/turned.png) |
| mfcadpp 10224 | Still **one A3**, at 2:1. Measured section A–A fits beside the principal row; captions, ordinate stacks and hole leaders fit inside the border. | [10224.png](../target/detail-main-merge/renders/10224.png) |

The spindle is not a globally finding-free drawing. As documented on main in
`docs/datum-placement.md`, non-datum GD&T findings remain: two reciprocal reports of the
ø4 bore leader crossing the position frame, one frame leader through a recognized feature,
and three reservation overruns. CLI structural review also reports `leader_line_through_text`
for A and B: their stem endpoints lie exactly on the datum-box boundary (A at y=71.82;
B at x=66.00), while the letters are visibly clear inside their boxes. These boundary-contact
reports remain in the review JSON; no lint rule or threshold was changed. The local render
helper initially asserted zero crossings for *all* spindle annotations, which was broader
than the requested datum check; its saved criterion now explicitly separates zero datum
crossings from the remaining reports. Nominal-rounding warnings remain visible on
string_post and 10224; turned's structural review is empty.

All evidence for this integration is under `target/detail-main-merge/`. The historical
`target/detail-merge/` evidence below belongs to the previous merge.


## Merge onto main `53aa9f3f`

This verification supersedes the earlier implementation's check and delivery status below.
The merge combines detail commit `7e29f66b` with `origin/main` at `53aa9f3f`;
`git log 253b7601..origin/main` and the F1, K4 and K5 implementation/review changes were
read before resolving the conflicts. The original source trace and comparison artifacts are
retained below as historical evidence against base `253b7601`.

### Conflict resolutions

* `src/model.rs`: retained F1's outer `rule` loop, lazy `is_small` / `fits_a3_at_full_size`,
  invalid-large-seed handling and the fallback to large sheets only when A4/A3 have no valid
  drawing. Derived details are excluded from whole-principal envelope tests, including the
  full-size A3 test. Detail-aware demand fitting, `iso_factor_with_detail`, head-sheet retention
  and detail quality gates run within the new scale loop. Kept both the detail markers/captions
  and F1's thin manufacturing layer. F1's independent section lift and fixed GD&T corridors remain.
* `src/dims/leaders.rs`: kept K4's shared material re-entry predicate and depth, F1's
  grazing-angle guard, and the detail branch's extension clearance, shorter-route gates,
  opposite-silhouette candidates and protection against new text contacts. Refinement may
  increase neither the original hard/crossing scores nor the grazing score. Pinned detail
  callouts now participate in the same re-entry report as principal-view callouts.
* `src/dims/turned.rs`: kept the default common inspection end for a whole connected multi-step
  turned profile, with PMI first, otherwise the larger flat end (low end for a tie). Axial
  feature locations use that same end. K5's separate-body profile grouping, separating view,
  body silhouette witnesses and side strips remain intact; separate bodies do not acquire
  a shared whole-part datum. K5's groove ownership, pad, slot and lint rules are unchanged.

The Z-axis automatic head extension is restricted to whole turned parts: a connected pin on
an assembly plate must not introduce a head crop that displaces main's valid small-sheet
candidate. Automatic turned crops preserve established GD&T frame corridors and principal
scale; explicitly authored crops retain precedence. A refused optional crop is not by itself
an active detail quality veto. Thread/knurl ink now uses the detail's centre and clips to its
crop. Drawn frames record the equivalent whole-part-centre offset, so independent K4 lint
projects the same geometry as the drawing.

F1's toleranced string-post test used the identical saved spec but expected its pre-detail
5:1 mains. Its exact merged assertion is now A4 2:1 **and** a present head B at 10:1.
Every original hard-finding, tolerance-coverage and sheet-rule assertion remains. The GD&T
control still asserts A3 5:1. No test is disabled, no threshold relaxed, and no CI quality or
leader-route baseline is re-recorded. A new external-thread detail regression verifies
nonempty conventional ink, crop containment and the recorded world-to-page transform.

The full run exposed a genuine R5 integration failure: the optional head displaced the
inspection schedule added by F1's overflow fixture. Automatic crops now release their
reservations when required tables/notes cannot be placed. A declared schedule combined with
an explicit minimum main scale takes precedence over an automatic turned crop; authored
details keep precedence. The table, two overflow prefixes, complete dimension inventory,
three sheet steps, one plan per edit, wire limits and 150 ms timing assertions remain intact.

Stateless reconstruction then exposed repeated placement and table-metric work. Bounded
process memos retain exact sheet candidates (64), dimension placements (64), and fixed-font
cell ink spans (128). Candidate keys cover the complete Analysis and Spec. Placement keys
cover the complete Analysis, physical sheet/view geometry, spec intent, held ink, obstacles
and exclusions; only unread title cell text and explanatory metadata are omitted. The actual
title-block rectangle stays in the key. Results are owned clones; edited PMI or geometry
invalidates reuse. Table metrics use exact outlines, unchanged sums and fixed font/height.
The allocator/recovery still run and check every prefix; no planner counter is fabricated.
Shared-cache locks only update reference counts and queues; large clones, replacements and
evictions run outside the locks. A re-entrant clone/drop probe enforces that rule. Recovery
reuses the complete Analysis digest already computed in the call instead of serializing the
same Analysis once per overflow prefix.
Warm persisted projections also track changes to binding, projected views, cuts and placed
geometry, so unchanged caches avoid a redundant 3.3 MB serialization/read on R5 title edits.
Successful projection-file parses use a four-entry content-keyed memo for inputs up to 8 MiB.
Every file byte remains in its SHA-256 key; changed or malformed files are parsed again.
Returned caches are owned clones with zero restored work counters and clean persisted state.
The regression also checks that editing a loaded cache cannot mutate a later reload.
The disk format and durability guarantees remain unchanged. Independent immutable Spec, delta
and history files flush concurrently, with `sync_all` on each; only after all succeed is the
head published. A failure-path regression obstructs the artifact directory, verifies that the
parent remains live, removes the obstruction and successfully retries. A cache regression verifies clean
reconstruction/title edits, dirty scale edits, exact cache bytes and fresh-render parity.

The 150 ms session and R5 wall-clock gates, operation counts, complete delta replay, HTTP
limits and cold/warm/fresh-process parity assertions remain unchanged. Diagnostic timing
runs exposed intermittent waits: one NIST edit took 338.012 ms wall time but only 20.195 ms
of its thread's CPU time; an isolated NIST run passed at 48.913 ms. Temporary instruction,
CPU and stage traces were removed from the final source. The final required full-suite result
is recorded below. A keep-awake experiment did not eliminate the waits, and moving
the process out of background priority was not permitted, so no scheduling promotion is used.
Session now retains one exact assembled preview drawing, keyed by its Spec and PMI. The
session's Part, font and recognized geometry are immutable; PMI is the only Analysis field
its editing API replaces. Every evaluation still runs the planner, geometry placement,
annotation work and delta calculation. Only identical assembled drawing ink is reused.
Existing preview/commit, undo/redo, changed-PMI and fresh-render parity tests enforce this.
The final-source focused run passes R5 (34.219 ms session p90, 78.962 ms MCP p90), all eight
session cases (NIST p90 44.629 ms), and all fourteen stateless cases, with six test threads.
Evidence: `target/detail-merge/latency-preview-render.log`.
The full PMI drawing comparison also found two obsolete view-difference exceptions:
`manufacturing_requirement:#722` on `hw_thumbwheel_notes_add.step` and
`thumbwheel_thread_knurl.step` now matches the reference front view. Those two exceptions
were removed; no new exception was added (349 remaining instead of 351).

The merged X-head placement exposed a genuine 1.1 mm band overrun on GRM-03's 2 mm
local length. Its top reservation now includes the first dimension gap plus two text heights
(16 mm instead of 12 mm); the label remains clear without relaxing lint. The existing GRM-03
regression now also forbids `annotation_outside_area`. Its corrected diagnostic has zero ink
findings, and the 119-callout route guard passes.

### Drawings inspected

All four PNGs were opened and inspected for supported witnesses, common origins, text/line
contacts, dimension/section identification, readable scales and sheet boundaries. SVGs,
plan JSON and render reports accompany each PNG under `target/detail-merge/renders/`.
All four final PNGs are byte-identical to the inspected images before the performance changes;
`target/detail-merge/png-final-comparison.json` records their hashes.

| Case | Result | Visual inspection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| string_post default | A4 2:1; detail B 10:1 | Front heights 3.8, 6.5, 7.6 and 14.8 share the high flat end; the 1 mm flange and 2× R0.2 are legible in B. |
| exact saved 14-tolerance spec | One A4 at 2:1; B 10:1; every item on sheet 1 | All 14 tolerances remain on their original quantities. Independent toleranced band lengths sit opposite the inspection baseline. No crossed text or off-sheet labels. |
| `cnc-review-spindle.step.gz` | A4 1:1 | PMI baseline, datums A/B, fits, internal thread, diamond knurl and section remain readable. |
| turned.step | A3 2:1 | 40 and 70 locate shoulders from the larger low end; no redundant reference chain. |

The saved-spec fixture key is
`string_post.step:spec:1c29f39db68e8b009a719d83ec1389d96a1e350a2d6b4bc142069453c99e3569`.
The spindle was decompressed directly from `tests/fixtures/samples/cnc-review-spindle.step.gz`
into `target/detail-merge/spindle.step`. The spec still reports its four informational
reservation overruns. The spindle retains exactly the previous detail commit's finding counts,
including five leader crossings, three reservation overruns and one leader-through-feature
finding; these are reported, not removed or waived.

* string_post: [PNG](/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-paul-repos-quiddity-rust/4f6aac0c-d5a0-4c82-bc67-2d2552947882/scratchpad/cx-detail/target/detail-merge/renders/string_post.png)

The full-size sheet rule is evaluated with main's exact 20 mm dimension row on each side
of each principal/section view, against A3's usable 400 × 277 mm. The diagnostic comparison
finds no newly large-sheet **small** part among all 30. Hanger is the only new large-sheet
choice relative to main (A2 1:1 with its crop versus main's reduced A3 1:2): its full-size row
is 427.3268 mm and its column 280.52 mm, so F1 classifies it as eligible for large paper.
It is deliberately not reclassified as small merely because a reduced A3 drawing exists.
The final per-part calculation and main comparison are linked in the checks below.

### Required checks on the merged tree

The final required commands ran one at a time with `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6` and
`RUST_TEST_THREADS=6`. The release suite used the required corpus at
`/Users/paul/repos/quiddity/tests/corpus` with `DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS_REQUIRED=1`.
Normal process scheduling and the original 150 ms gates were used.

The leader guard preserves the original base + 2 mm length limit and forbids new hidden,
section or cut crossings and new material runs over 2 mm. Fourteen unchanged pre-existing

## Original implementation report — base `253b7601`, commit `7e29f66b`

The default string post now uses A4 at 2:1, with head detail B at 10:1 and section A–A.
The fitting isometric stays at sheet scale (2:1); it therefore needs no NTS caption.
Default front-view heights are 3.8 to the cross hole, 6.5 and 7.6 to shoulders, and 14.8 overall,
all from the high flat end. Shortest ordinates stand nearest the part. The 1 mm flange and
2× R0.2 callout belong to the head detail. Its teeth are visible in the enlarged exact geometry.

The exact saved spec `string_post.step:spec:1c29f39db68e8b009a719d83ec1389d96a1e350a2d6b4bc142069453c99e3569`
retains all 14 tolerances on their original quantities. It also uses A4 at 2:1 with detail B
at 10:1 and has no reported label/ink crossing or off-sheet annotation. Its explicitly toleranced
local band lengths stay independent on the opposite side from the inspection baseline.
Applying a tolerance on a 1.1 mm band to a cumulative 7.6 mm position would change manufacturing
intent; the port deliberately retains J4's independent controlling requirement instead.
Before this change the same saved spec consumed A2 at 10:1.
Four informational `annotation_outside_area` findings remain on that saved spec: its long
tolerance labels extend 3.8–19 mm beyond estimated front-view bands. They remain inside the
sheet and clear of other annotation ink; those reservation overruns are reported, not hidden.

Python tests consulted include `test_detail_views.py`, `test_derived_view_planning.py`,
`test_auxiliary_layout.py`, `test_compiled_plan_boundary.py:1060`, and the GRM03 axial/detail
scenarios. Exact approved requirement IDs pass through the ordinary Rust dimension planner;
no secondary ladder is reconstructed in rendering. Details have stable `v:detail_a`–`v:detail_h`
IDs, a source camera, model crop, absolute scale, owned IDs and authored/default metadata.
Authored feature crops retain an exact multiple of main scale. Omission does not rename details.
Section and detail letters share an allocation, including remote sections.

## Deliberate drawing choices and limits

* A thin terminal flange on a Z-turned whole part also requests a head detail. Python's automatic
  head producer only covers X; this extension is required for the reported string-post problem.
* PMI datum ends and authored baseline lengths take precedence. Otherwise the larger flat end
  (end diameter as the available geometric proxy) wins; the low end breaks a tie.
* Automatic details cannot force a larger initial sheet, or add annotation conflicts or longer
  leaders. An explicit smallest-scale constraint keeps its precedence. A declined optional crop
  releases its reservations; required dimensions remain on the source. Head details keep their
  compact sheet; prismatic layouts can still use the existing fill search.
* Prismatic details use the minimum readable absolute scale, at least 1.2 times parent scale.
  Python also searches preferred larger/half-step scales. Different supporting geometry and
  page reservations therefore produce different detail scales; the survey below records them.
* The requested parent circle replaces Python's present rectangular crop marker. Its exact arcs
  break behind annotation text and at the drawable boundary; the identifying letter avoids view
  and dimension ink. Captions and scale fidelity use the same independent structural lint pass.
* The Rust kernel has no solid Boolean crop. Exact projected curve intervals are clipped instead;
  this preserves existing outlines but creates no new cut-face caps. Supported strips are labelled
  PARTIAL PROFILE. This remains a geometric difference from Python's cropped solid.
* Native string-post recognition supplies no tooth/knurl feature or manufacturing pitch record.
  The enlarged teeth are drawn, but no numeric pitch/count requirement is invented. Existing
  authored/PMI knurl requirements continue through their diameter owner into a detail.

## Regression evidence

`tests/detail_views.rs` covers the A4/head result, common axial origin, extension/text clearance,
no stray detail (with a positive head witness), authored exact scale, saved chain tolerance IDs,
the complete 14-tolerance saved spec, approved prismatic/Y-chain ownership, letter allocation,
and omission identity. The pre-change executable rejects the authored `detail` field and produces
no head view, mixed origins and the old sheet choices; its outputs are retained below.

The executable-level witnesses in `regression_cli.py` exercise the five requested conditions
without relying on the new Rust types: all five fail against the saved pre-change executable
(`regression-before.log`), and all five pass against the final executable
(`regression-after.log`). The no-detail condition includes a positive fine-region witness,
so a generator that never produces details cannot pass it.

Existing connected-profile assertions now expect baseline positions. Original chain/reference,
omission and pin invariants are also exercised on explicitly independent profiles; none of those
invariants was removed. Crop-aware test bounds replace the former whole-part envelopes. Captured
bad section ink retains its original carrier frame so it is translated, rather than erased, when
layout moves. Comparison catalogues enumerate exact moved quantities and views; they do not waive
coverage or collisions. The single-sheet byte fixtures and CI quality baseline are unchanged.

## Selected PNG inspection

I inspected each before/after/Python PNG for geometry, dimension origins, witness support,
text/line contacts, detail identification and scale. The simple turned part loses its redundant
reference link; the spindle retains its PMI baseline, datums, thread and knurl requirements.
The two stair specimens retain A3 at 5:1 in the default fill search: their rungs are readable
at that main scale, so the optional detail disappears. With A4 at 1:1 explicitly selected, both
recover approved height rungs into supported details (2.333:1 and 3.5:1); the isometric
stays at the 1:1 sheet scale. Python defaults to A4 at 2:1 with preferred details at 3:1 and 4:1.
This remaining default packing difference is visible in the artifacts. The two controls keep no detail;
pre-existing recognition differences from Python remain visible in their dimension inventories.
Python's string-post spec comparison applies its 13 supported size tolerances through the Python
API; its cross-hole location tolerance is unavailable through that handle and is not claimed as
an exact 14-tolerance replay. Rust replays the exact saved spec.

Two corpus prismatic defaults were also rendered and inspected: 10060 retains its supported height crop on A4 (detail 3.5:1 versus Python 4:1); sm-hanger uses A2 at 1:1, with detail 1.75:1 versus Python 2:1. Hanger's supported strip is legible. On 10060 the exact projection crop leaves disconnected outline fragments where the solid has no projected edge; Python's Boolean crop supplies connecting cap edges. The PARTIAL PROFILE caption states that limitation. Recognised height inventories also differ (Rust's approved 11.3 mm rung versus Python's 13.3 mm rung).

## Historical quality and route gates

No cell among the 30 × 10 CI metrics is worse than `tools/ci-quality-baseline.json`.
The unchanged pre-change executable reproduced all 300 baseline cells before the port.
The baseline was not re-recorded. Every improvement is listed below. Visible-edge precedence
now applies to the isometric too, so hidden strokes no longer duplicate its visible ink.

The evidence is `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-paul-repos-quiddity-rust/4f6aac0c-d5a0-4c82-bc67-2d2552947882/scratchpad/detail-work/sheet-size-check.json`. String_post’s saved spec improves from A2 at
10:1 to A4 at 2:1.

The semantic comparison catalogues were updated for exact relocated quantities/views and
new inspection-arrow/leader bands: `known_dimensions.json`, `known_views.json`,
`known_bands.json`, two PMI manufacturing riders, and the removed CTC01 repeated label.
The connector109 baseline removes five previously allowed leader crossings; its changed
joint nine-callout search now truthfully reports the existing 200000-step cap. Every item
remains drawn; optimality is unproven. No ink threshold, coverage check, route guard,
single-sheet byte fixture, or quality baseline was relaxed.

The first full verification run exposed a NIST session latency regression under six test
threads (one 442 ms sample; a complete-target retry also exceeded 150 ms). The gate stayed
enabled. Detail requests and identical dimension-placement inputs now share preparation
within one immutable planning call; leader refinement rejects routes already over its
length budget and computes ranking scores once. No geometry or clearance predicate is
relaxed. Temporary profiling instrumentation was removed. The focused session and multi-sheet
gates then passed (NIST p90 135 ms, MCP p90 99 ms); the final corpus run below uses this code.
All 12 regenerated Rust PNGs are byte-identical to the inspected pre-optimization renders
(`render-performance-comparison.json` in the scratch directory).
All 30 quality-part plan JSON files are also byte-identical, and every final quality result
matches the pre-optimization audit (`plan-performance-comparison.json`).

## Original checks and delivery (historical)

The final source was checked in the requested order, with the cargo environment loaded,
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6` and `RUST_TEST_THREADS=6`:

The full test command used
`DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS=/Users/paul/repos/quiddity/tests/corpus DRAFTWRIGHT_CORPUS_REQUIRED=1`.
It exited 101 solely for the seven HTTP tests in `tests/stateless.rs`: their server cannot
bind a socket in this sandbox, so the listener never supplies a port. All six non-HTTP
stateless tests pass, including warm-cache/fresh-process identity and published schemas.
The unchanged session target passes all eight tests, including NIST; the isometric/NTS
target passes all 21 tests; all nine new detail tests pass. No gate was disabled.
The single-sheet byte guard remains opt-in and was not enabled or re-recorded.

The test-run CLI is byte-identical to the final quality/render CLI:
`706d7f8d0c5258dd4b765bc7b9c5b2e847d90c35e7c8510737fd0a1fb0ccaf88`. Machine-readable check results are [here](/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-paul-repos-quiddity-rust/4f6aac0c-d5a0-4c82-bc67-2d2552947882/scratchpad/detail-work/final-checks.json).

The sandbox repeatedly denies staging:
`/Users/paul/repos/draftwright-rust/.git/worktrees/wt-detail/index.lock: Operation not permitted`.
Consequently **no commits were possible**, and nothing was pushed. Changes remain in the
authorised worktree on `cx/detail-views`. Cumulative patch checkpoints preserve the work;
the final complete patch, including new gzipped fixtures, is
[06-detail-views.patch](/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-paul-repos-quiddity-rust/4f6aac0c-d5a0-4c82-bc67-2d2552947882/scratchpad/detail-work/checkpoints/06-detail-views.patch).
